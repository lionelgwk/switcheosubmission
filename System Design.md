The service needs to be able to retrieve the transaction information from the POST request from the API. A private key is required for the broadcaster to sign the transaction as well.

It should be able to send RPC requests to nodes to broadcast the transaction that has been succesfully signed.

It needs a error catching function as well, implementing this in TypeScript should be very possible with the try, catch clause.

How the process may go:

Making use of a microservice architecture:

1. Making use of the API, once a POST request is fired, the transaction information can be found within the request.

2. This information can be passed with a Message Oriented Middleware, perhaps RabbitMQ, where the “Signing Microservice" will subscribe to an exchange through a routing key. The message broker can be set the durable, so messages will survive a broker restart to prevent data loss.

3. The "Signing" microservice will consume the messages in the queue and retrieve the transaction information and verify its validity and sign it. This information will be passed to the "Signing" Microservice.

4. The services requires a private key to sign the transaction data. The private key can be stored in an environment variable or using encryption to ensure its security.

5. After which, the microservice will send a Remote Procedure Call request, perhaps with JSONRPCRequest() to broadcast it. A try catch clause can be used to handle the success and failure of the request.

Success
6. If the request succeeds, the service will return code 200 successful response to the user.


Failure
6. If the request fails, the service will retry the RPC request with a maximum of three tries before return code 500 of failure.

7. In the “Logging” Microservice, the transactions will be logged in a database with their transaction information and their statuses, whether they succeeded or failed.
